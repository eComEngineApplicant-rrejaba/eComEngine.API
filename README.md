# eComEngine.API

eComEngine Technical Exercise by applicant rrejaba

What we use in my current employment is .NetFramework 4.8.

This is the first time that I've used .Net6.0 and LiteDB so it was fun learning something new today ^__^

The solution is simple, my goal is not to overcomplicate it especially that what Iâ€™ve used is something new to me.
-	No security/authentication was implemented
-	API URL is https://localhost:7020/api/v1/Contacts

SwaggerUI will show the end points and can be used in testing
-	https://localhost:7020/swagger/index.html

Do a "Restore Nuget Packages" if the solution wont build due to missing packages

I'm not sure what to put on "/contacts/call-list" endpoint
- I have no implemention for it
